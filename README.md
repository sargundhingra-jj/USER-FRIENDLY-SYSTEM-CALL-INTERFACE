# USER-FRIENDLY-SECURE-SYSTEM-CALL-INTERFACE
USER-FRIENDLY SECURE SYSTEM CALL INTERFACE

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on creating a safe system call interface with enhanced security features. It ensures that only users who are verified can run system commands and it maintains a detailed record of who accessed what.

Key Features

Dual Interface - Command-line and graphical interfaces for flexible user interaction
Strong Authentication - Username/password verification with optional two-factor authentication
Extensive Logging - Comprehensive audit trails for all authentication attempts and system calls
Role-Based Access Control - User permissions based on assigned roles
Secure System Call Execution - Protected command execution with input validation
User-Friendly GUI - Intuitive graphical interface for easier system interaction
PROJECT ARCHITECTURE
The whole project is divided into three main pieces:

Authentication Module – This takes care of user logins and verifies their identities.
Logging Module – This keeps track of everything that happens, like login attempts and commands run.
System Call Handler – This makes sure that system commands are executed safely only by authorized users.
GUI Interface - Provides graphical access to all system features
These components work together to create a cohesive security framework while maintaining ease of use.

OVERVIEW OF MODULES

AUTHENTICATION MODULE (auth_module.cpp & auth_module.h)
Purpose:
The Authentication Module checks the identity of users before they can access the system. Its job is to keep credentials safe and log both successful and failed login attempts.

Core Functionalities:

Maintains a list of users who are allowed access (found in users.h).
Uses SHA-256 to securely hash passwords.
Confirms user credentials against the stored information.
Files:

auth_module.cpp: Contains the code that handles user login processes.
auth_module.h: Lists the functions for user authentication tasks.
users.h: Holds user credentials in a secure manner.
Key Functions:

bool isValidUser(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; password): Checks if the provided username and password are correct.
std::string hashPassword(const std::string&amp; password): Hashes the given password with SHA-256 for security.
void logAuthentication(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; status): Logs the outcome of login attempts.
std::string getUserRole(const std::string&amp; username): Identifies the role of the user, indicating whether they are an Admin or just a regular User.
LOGGING MODULE (log_manager.cpp & log_manager.h)
Purpose:
The Logging Module is responsible for tracking every authentication attempt and any system calls that are made. This helps create a clear record for security reviews later.

Core Features:

Records when users try to log in, including the times of attempts.
Logs every system call that is executed for monitoring purposes.
Allows retrieval of logs whenever necessary.
Tracks errors to identify what went wrong.
Files:

log_manager.cpp: Implements the logging functionality.
log_manager.h: Defines the logging-related functions.
auth_log.txt: Holds records of all authentication attempts.
syscall_log.txt: Contains records of all system calls made.
Key Functions:

void logEvent(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; event): Logs what system calls are executed.
void logError(const std::string&amp; errorMessage): Records any errors that the system encounters.
void displayLogs(): Shows all logs of login attempts and executed commands.
SECURE SYSTEM CALL HANDLER (syscall_handler.cpp & syscall_handler.h)
Purpose:
This module ensures that only authenticated users can safely execute system commands.

Core Features:

Verifies if the user is authenticated before allowing them to run system calls.
Executes commands in a safe way to prevent misuse.
Logs every command that's executed for security monitoring.
Ensures that permission to access features is based on the user's role.
Blocks unauthorized commands from going through.
Files:

syscall_handler.cpp: Responsible for securely executing system calls.
syscall_handler.h: Lists functions related to managing system calls.
syscall_log.txt: Stores logs of all commands that were executed.
Key Functions:

void secureSystemCall(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; command): Handles the secure execution of commands.
bool isAuthorizedUser(const std::string&amp; username): Checks if the user is permitted to carry out the commands.
void logSystemCall(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; command): Keeps a security log of executed commands.
GUI Interface Purpose Provides user-friendly graphical access to all system features

Key Features:

Intuitive login screen with 2FA support
Dashboard for system monitoring
Command execution panel with history
Real-time log viewer
User management interface (admin only)
Key Components:

auth_screen.py - Handles login and 2FA verification
dashboard.py - Main user interface after authentication
system_call_panel.py - Interface for executing system calls
log_viewer.py - Visual interface for reviewing system logs
Workflow

Authentication: Users provide credentials via CLI or GUI
Verification: System validates credentials and optional 2FA
Authorization: System checks user permissions for requested actions
Execution: Commands are sanitized and executed securely
Logging: All activities are recorded for audit purposes
** Functionality Summary** Each part works as intended:

Login & Registration via CLI and GUI

Role-Based Access Control

2FA in GUI

Command Execution with Restrictions

Logs Viewable via GUI + Export to File

Dashboard showing last commands & activity
